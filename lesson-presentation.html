        <h2>👋 Why This Lesson Matters for Your Writing and Speaking</h2>
        <p>Subject-verb agreement is one of the most important skills in English because it affects how professional and clear your communication sounds. When subjects and verbs agree correctly, your sentences flow naturally and your meaning is crystal clear. Whether you're writing an email, giving a presentation, or chatting with friends, proper subject-verb agreement makes you sound confident and educated.</p>
        
        <p>Think about it: when someone says "The students is working hard" instead of "The students are working hard," it immediately sounds wrong to our ears. That's because subject-verb agreement is so fundamental to English that errors jump out at listeners and readers. Mastering this skill will make all of your writing stronger!</p>

        <h2>✏️ The Golden Rule of Subject-Verb Agreement</h2>
        <div class="exercise">
            <h3>📋 The Simple Pattern That Works Every Time</h3>
            <div style="background: linear-gradient(135deg, #d4f1d4 0%, #b8e6b8 100%); padding: 25px; border-radius: 15px; margin: 20px 0;">
                <p><strong style="font-size: 1.2em; color: #2d5a3d;">SINGULAR SUBJECT</strong> → <strong style="font-size: 1.2em; color: #2d5a3d;">VERB ENDS WITH -S</strong></p>
                <p><em>Example: The student work<strong>s</strong> hard.</em></p>
                <br>
                <p><strong style="font-size: 1.2em; color: #2d5a3d;">PLURAL SUBJECT</strong> → <strong style="font-size: 1.2em; color: #2d5a3d;">VERB HAS NO -S</strong></p>
                <p><em>Example: The students work hard.</em></p>
            </div>
            
            <h3>🔍 How to Remember This</h3>
            <p><strong>Memory trick:</strong> In most cases, if you can put "one" in front of the subject, the verb needs an -s. If you can put "many" in front of the subject, the verb doesn't need an -s.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>"One teacher explains" → The teacher explain<strong>s</strong></li>
                <li>"Many teachers explain" → The teachers explain</li>
            </ul>

                <li><strong>Listen to yourself:</strong> If something sounds wrong when you say it, it probably is</li>
                <li><strong>Use simple subjects first:</strong> Start with clear, obvious subjects before tackling complex sentences</li>

            <h3>🚫 Mistake #1: Confusing Collective Nouns</h3>
            <div style="background: #f8d7da; padding: 20px; border-radius: 10px; margin: 15px 0;">
                <p><strong>❌ Wrong:</strong> "The team <em>are</em> practicing today."</p>
                <p><strong>✅ Right:</strong> "The team <em>is</em> practicing today."</p>
                <p><strong>Why:</strong> Words like "team," "class," "family," and "group" are collective nouns. Even though they refer to multiple people, they act as one unit, so they take singular verbs.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="exercise">
            <h3>🚫 Mistake #2: Getting Confused by "Of" Phrases</h3>

                <p><strong>❌ Wrong:</strong> "Each of the students <em>have</em> finished their project."</p>
                <p><strong>✅ Right:</strong> "Each of the students <em>has</em> finished their project."</p>
                <p><strong>Why:</strong> The subject is "each," not "students." The phrase "of the students" is just extra information. "Each" is always singular, so it needs "has."</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="exercise">
            <h3>🚫 Mistake #3: Indefinite Pronoun Confusion</h3>

                    <li><strong>The Core Rule:</strong> Singular subjects take verbs with -s; plural subjects take verbs without -s</li>
                    <li><strong>Context Matters:</strong> Subject-verb agreement appears in all types of writing, from emails to stories</li>
                    <li><strong>Watch for Tricky Cases:</strong> Collective nouns, "of" phrases, and indefinite pronouns have special rules</li>
                    <li><strong>Trust Your Ear:</strong> Correct agreement usually sounds right when you read it aloud</li>

                <p><strong>💡 Pro Tip:</strong> When you're unsure about a sentence, try removing any phrases between the subject and verb. This will help you see the core subject-verb relationship more clearly.</p>
                <p><strong>Example:</strong> "The box [of old photographs] sits on the shelf." Remove the phrase → "The box sits on the shelf." ✓</p>
